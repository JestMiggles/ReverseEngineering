## CS 479 Questions

**1. What is the difference between machine code and assembly?**

The difference is that machine code is a high level language that is compiled to be read by the CPU, while assembly is a low level language that is used by us to analyze and tell what the program is doing.

**2. If the ESP register is pointing to memory address 0x001270A4 and I execute a `push eax` instruction, what address will ESP now be pointing to?**

When you do a `push eax` instruction, it will decrement the address by 4 bytes, making the new address being pointed to 0x001270A0.

**3. What is a stack frame?**

A stack frame clarifies the organization of stacks. This means that it stores local variables on the stack.

**4. What would you find in a data section?**

You would find a collection of the files global and static local variables.

**5. What is the heap used for?**

The heap is used for allocating space for new values and freeing space when said values are no longer of use.

**6. What is in the code section of a program's virtual memory space?**

The executable code is in the program's virtual memory space.

**7. What does the `inc` instruction do, and how many operands does it take?**

The `inc` instruction increments a register by one and is a single operand.

**8. If I perform a `div` instruction, where would I find the remainder of the binary division (modulo)?**

If you perform the `div` instruction, you will find the remainder of the modulo in the EDX register.

**9. How does `jz` decide whether to jump or not?**

`jz` decides whether to jump based on the ZF flag. If the ZF flag is 1, it jumps. Otherwise, it doesn't jump.

**10. How does `jne` decide whether to jump or not?**

`jne` decides whether to jump or not based on the ZF flag. If the ZF flag is 0, it jumps, otherwise it doesn't.

**11. What does a `mov` instruction do?**

A `mov` instruction can move data into registers or RAM.

**12. What does the `TF` flag do and why is it useful for debugging?**

The `TF` flag makes it so that the processor will only execute one instruction at a time, making it easier to see what your code is doing and where the error may be occuring.

I WILL DO THE REST LATER, ITS MY BIRTHDAY AND I WANNA CELEBRATE. IF YOU SEE THIS BEFORE I FINISH JUST KNOW I WILL TAKE ANY LATE PENALTIES THIS MAY CAUSE ME. THANKS AND HAVE A GOOD DAY :D
