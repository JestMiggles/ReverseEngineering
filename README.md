# CS479/579 Reverse Engineering at NMSU

## Summary
This repo will hold your reports on reverse engineering malware samples from "Practical Malware Analysis".

## Setup
In order to setup my system for reverse engineering, I had to format a USB to run Ubuntu off of rather than my own system, since my original system is in Windows. After preparing my USB for Ubuntu, I was able to dual-boot my system into Ubuntu. Next, I installed a Windows virtual machine to run the malware.

## Installed
We currently have not ran software on our machines, however this section will be updated in the future.

## Lab 1-1
### Executive Summary

While analyzing the software, I discovered a file "kerne132.dll" within the system32 file directory, indicating that this file may have been used to create a backdoor into our system.
